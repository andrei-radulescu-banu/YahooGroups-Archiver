#YahooGroups-Archiver

##A simple python script that archives all messages from a public Yahoo Group

Yahoo Groups is "one of the worlds largest collections of online discussion boards". It was launched in 1998 as Yahoo Clubs.

However, Yahoo does not seem to care for it, putting your data at risk. In fact in 2013, Yahoo shut down Yahoo Groups Japan.

Don't let Yahoo delete your data: create a backup with YahooGroups-Archiver.
